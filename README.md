Othello (Reversi) – Single-Page Web Game

This is a simple Othello (Reversi) game implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, designed to run entirely in a single HTML file.

The game allows the player to compete only against a computer (COM), making it easy to play casually without online matchmaking or setup.

🎯 Three difficulty levels

Easy

Normal

Hard

📄 Single-page implementation

No build tools

No external libraries

⚡ Instant launch

Just open the HTML file in a browser

🎨 Simple and clean UI for clarity and readability

Tech Stack

HTML – Structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Game logic and AI behavior

No frameworks or dependencies are used.

How to Play

Open the HTML file in your web browser.

Select the difficulty level.

You play as Black, the computer plays as White.

Click on a valid square to place your stone.

The game ends when no more valid moves are available.

The player with more stones on the board wins.

AI Logic (Overview)

Easy: Chooses a random valid move

Normal: Uses basic heuristics (e.g. number of flips)

Hard: Prioritizes strategic positions such as corners and edges

The AI is intentionally kept lightweight and readable rather than overly complex.
